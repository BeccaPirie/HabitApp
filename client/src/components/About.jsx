                    HabitBuild has been designed as a tool to help aid habit formation, as building and maintaining new habits 
                    can be challenging for many. Many existing habit tracking applications, although popular, aren't backed by research
                    and in fact may hinder the habit formation process. Therefore, the goal of HabitBuild is to help you successfuly 
                    integrate new habits into your daily routine by using techniques that are proven to help.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Habits are formed when a new behaviour is repeated in the same context, as overtime intentions and goals become 
                    less of the influence to carry them out, and the influence of habit begins to increase. Many existing habit 
                    tracking applications use time-based cues to remind users to complete the new behaviour, which can result in 
                    dependency of the application as users start relying on these reminders to carry out the habit. Therefore, 
                    this application relies on event-based cues to help integrate new habits into your daily routine. These are events 
                    that you want to integrate the habit around. For example, after breakfast, or before going to bed. To begin with 
                    youâ€™ll receive daily notifications after the event cue has passed to help keep you on track, but these will 
                    be faded out over time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Another aspect this application focuses on is dealing with conflicting thoughts and feelings which may arise and 
                    prevent you from carrying out the habit. When you add a new habit, you'll be asked to identify any thoughts or actions that may 
                    prevent you from wanting to carry out the habit, and then what you could do or tell yourself in these situations. 
                    An example is if you are trying to implement healthier eating habits, you could tell yourself you will ignore any 
                    thoughts regarding the foods you are trying to avoid.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In addition to these features, for each habit you can add a list of to-dos and monitor any thoughts or notes in the 
                    journal section. Lastly, you can mark your progress on the calendar and view this data in a chart to see your progress!
